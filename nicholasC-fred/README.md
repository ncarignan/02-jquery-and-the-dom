## Overview
We are building a blog site to the designer's specifications. We were to mirror a few images of the sample site provided by the customer.

## Getting Started
We were given starter code with the html file completed. You would have to layout a CSS structure in which to build the design.
1. Normalize the CSS in vendor styles folder
1. Add SMACCS style files like base.css, layout.css, modules.css
1. Link them all in the head of the html
1. Set the viewport metatag in html
1. Starting with a topdown approach create the styles for the mobile version of the site
1. Again with a topdown approach, create the styles for the full version of the site
Day 2
1. Removed all articles from the Dom and used Nicholas and Rob's CSS to style the new page for Nicholas and Fred

## Architecture
We used CSS and modified an html file already given to us. We imported a normalized CSS file from https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/
